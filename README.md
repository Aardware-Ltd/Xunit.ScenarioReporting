# Xunit.ScenarioReporting

Adds a scenario testing framework to xunit that supports generating xml, html and markdown reports designed to be read by non programmers.

There are some examples in the examples project. To use the framework you need to add an assembly level attribute to your test assembly like this [one](https://github.com/jageall/Xunit.ScenarioReporting/blob/master/Examples/TestFrameworkAttribute.cs#L3)
